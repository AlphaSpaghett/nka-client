  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      The Norwalk Karting Association was founded by Robert Leblanc, Joe Ross
      and Bill Ely in 1971. Back then the club fielded less than 12 Karts. Today
      the club continues to have a very active membership and are averaging
      45-50+ karts weekly. The track is a road course just over a quarter mile
      in length. The course is set within the parking lot of calf Pasture Beach.
      Safety barriers, painted lines and cones outline the course. Temporary
      safety fence outlines the perimeter of the parking area during the racing
      event to aid in safety and prevent unauthorized access. Spectators are
      welcome to watch racing events from outside the perimeter of the safety
      fence. Anyone wishing to enter the pits or race must register at our sign
      in booth and receive a wrist band for insurance purposes. Safety is our
      number one priority!

      Kart drivers range in age from 5 years old on up. Youth classes are
      arranged by age. Depending on the age of the driver will determine the
      minimum weight, engine and size of restrictor plate used in the engine.
      This allows for safety and skill development. Senior classes have several
      other options to select from which generally involves the weight of the
      driver and the type of engine. this information is covered in our rule
      book. A driver's meeting is held prior to the start of each race day. Our
      race format includes one round of practice followed by three heat races
      per class. Points are tallied at the end of the day and the driver who
      accumulates the most points is the winner for that day. The race season
      runs from March through May, and from September through mid November. An
      awards banquet is held annually just after the winter holidays to honor
      our champions and special awards winners, as well as to honor all of our
      members for their participation and contributions to the club.
